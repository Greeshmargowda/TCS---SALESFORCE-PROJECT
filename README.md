# E - Commerce Order Management System
A compact, extendable Salesforce implementation to manage products, orders, inventory, and basic post-purchase automation.
# Project overview
This project builds a minimal, production-mindful e-commerce order management system inside Salesforce. It demonstrates:
- product catalog and inventory tracking  
- creating orders composed of order items (line items)  
- automated stock decrement when orders are placed  
- email notifications for shipment and post-delivery feedback requests  
- reporting and dashboards for revenue, orders and top products  
- optional Lightning Web Components (LWC) to provide a shopping cart / checkout experience.
